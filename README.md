🚀 Key Features

1️⃣ Asset Master Management

The Asset Master acts as the central record for each organizational asset.

It stores important information such as:

🆔 Asset ID

📦 Item No.

🏷️ Asset Type

📝 Description

🔢 Serial No.

📅 Purchase Date

💰 Purchase Cost

🛡️ Warranty Expiry Date

📌 Asset Status

👤 Employee No.

👤 Employee Name

The Asset Master provides a single view of the asset and its current information.

2️⃣ Asset Registration

The system allows users to register assets in Business Central.

During registration, the asset can be linked with relevant item information and assigned a unique Asset ID.

Process

📦 Asset Information
        ↓
📝 Asset Registration
        ↓
🆔 Asset ID Generated
        ↓
📋 Asset Master Created

3️⃣ 👤 Asset Assignment

Assets can be assigned to employees directly from the Asset Management solution.

The system maintains information such as:

Employee No.

Employee Name

Asset ID

Assignment Date

Asset Status

Assignment History

This improves accountability and makes it easy to identify the employee responsible for an asset.

4️⃣ 🔄 Asset Return & Reassignment

When an employee returns an asset, the system records the return and updates the asset status.

The asset can then become available for reassignment.

Process

👤 Assigned Asset
        ↓
↩️ Return Asset
        ↓
📌 Update Asset Status
        ↓
🟢 Available
        ↓
👤 Reassign Asset

5️⃣ 📊 Asset Status Tracking

The system tracks the current status of each asset.

Example statuses include:

🟢 Available

🔵 Assigned

🟠 Under Maintenance

🔴 Replaced

⚪ Returned

This provides users with clear visibility into the current state of organizational assets.

6️⃣ 🔧 Asset Maintenance Management

Maintenance activities can be recorded against individual assets.

Maintenance information can include:

🆔 Asset ID

📅 Maintenance Date

🔧 Maintenance Type

📝 Description

⚙️ Asset Condition

📌 Maintenance Status

💬 Remarks

This helps organizations maintain assets properly and improve asset reliability.

7️⃣ ♻️ Asset Replacement

The system supports replacement of assets when an existing asset needs to be replaced.

The replacement process helps maintain the relationship between the old and replacement assets and improves lifecycle visibility.

Process

📦 Existing Asset
        ↓
⚠️ Replacement Required
        ↓
♻️ Create Replacement Record
        ↓
📌 Update Asset Status
        ↓
🆕 Register Replacement Asset

8️⃣ 🕒 Asset History

Asset-related activities can be maintained as historical records.

The history can track:

👤 Assignment

↩️ Return

🔧 Maintenance

♻️ Replacement

📌 Status Changes

📝 Other Asset Activities

This provides better traceability and audit visibility.

9️⃣ 📑 Asset Management Reports

Custom reports provide management with useful information about organizational assets.

Reports can support:

👤 Employee-wise Asset Reports

📊 Asset Status Reports

📋 Asset Assignment Reports

🔧 Maintenance Reports

🕒 Asset History Reports

📈 Asset Management Analysis
